CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. It’s a good training to improve your command line skills!

Command line for the win
This is to elaborate on the steps I took to use the SFTP command-line tool in this project. This will help you (reviewer) understand how I performed the file transfer using SFTP.
After completing the “Command Challenge”. I took the needed screenshots as requested, and remanded them to match the task file names.
Steps
I launched my “Windows Powershell” on my local machine.
I connected to my sandbox using the “SFTP Command”
I “cd” to alx-higher_level_programming/command_line_for_the_win directory.
Once inside the directory, I used the command “put” in conjunction with the absolute path of the screenshots (0-first_9_tasks.png, 1-next_9_tasks.png & 2-next_9_tasks.png) on the local machine.
After the upload was completed, I connected to my sandbox using the “SSH Command” and pushed the uploaded files to Github.


God bless you for taking the time to review my project.
